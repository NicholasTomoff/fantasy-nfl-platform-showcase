# Demo Data

This directory contains **static, representative datasets** used to illustrate how the Fantasy NFL platform
consumes inputs and produces outputs across its core workflows.

These files are **not live data**, **not production exports**, and **not complete schemas**.
They are intentionally simplified to demonstrate **data shape, relationships, and flow** without exposing
implementation details or proprietary logic.

---

## Purpose of Demo Data

The demo data in this folder is intended to:

- Illustrate the **inputs** required by core backend workflows
- Show the **outputs** generated by scoring and projection endpoints
- Support documentation, walkthroughs, and architectural discussion
- Provide realistic examples without exposing internal business logic

This data is **not** intended to be replayed in a running system.

---

## Files Included

### `weekly_picks.json`

Represents **user-submitted weekly picks** prior to scoring.

This file demonstrates:
- League-scoped user selections
- Positional picks (QB / RB / WR)
- The minimum information required to trigger weekly scoring

Example use:
- Input to the weekly scoring flow (`POST /score/week/{week}/league/{league_id}`)

---

### `player_game_stats.json`

Represents **player performance statistics** for a given week.

This file demonstrates:
- The shape of player-level stat data used during evaluation
- Separation between raw performance data and fantasy scoring logic
- Position-agnostic stat ingestion

Notes:
- Values are illustrative
- Data may be aggregated or simplified compared to production ingestion

---

### `weekly_score_output.json`

Represents the **final scoring result** after weekly scoring has been executed.

This file demonstrates:
- Total points accumulated by a user
- Positional point contributions
- All-position (triple-hit) bonuses
- The effect of streak-based scoring over time

This file reflects the **output state**, not the calculation process.

---

### `projected_max_points_output.json`

Represents the output of the **maximum projected points** calculation.

This file demonstrates:
- Forward-looking projections based on perfect future performance
- Accumulated positional and all-position streak growth
- Per-user projected totals used for leaderboard comparison

Example use:
- Output of `GET /league/{league_id}/projected-max-points`

---

## Important Constraints

- Demo data does **not** include:
  - Full database schemas
  - Historical data across multiple seasons
  - Validation rules or edge-case handling
  - Proprietary scoring thresholds or tuning parameters

- Field names and structures may be:
  - Simplified
  - Redacted
  - Renamed for clarity

The production system contains additional safeguards, validations, and optimizations not represented here.

---

## Relationship to Other Documentation

- API request/response contracts referencing these structures are documented in `/api_contracts`
- Sample implementation patterns related to these datasets are shown in `/sample_code`
- UI representations of this data can be seen in `/screenshots`

---

## Summary

This directory provides **just enough data** to understand:
- What the system expects
- What the system produces
- How data moves through the platform

without revealing **how the platform makes its decisions**.

That separation is intentional.
